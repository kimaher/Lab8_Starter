Graceful degradation and service workers are closely related in building resilient web applications because it refers to designing applications so that they maintain core functionality even when certain features fail or are unsupported. Service workers contribute to this by enabling offline capabilities, caching resources, and intercepting network requests. This means that when network connectivity is lost or limited, the service worker can serve cached content, allowing the application to still function in a reduced but usable formâ€”thereby supporting graceful degradation.
